A highly intelligent man is one who is tractable in their thinking and can adjust to changes. They critically think before they speak and act. They are able to successfully manage their emotions, and smartly abide by the laws and regulations of our nation. CUPID approves!”//]

CUPID may approve, but you are quite unsure. Your best friend Sarah married David from University, 10 years ago. He was a tech engineer and worked in the government. Sarah has been miserable with him, however divorce is illegal. 'He is too smart and too high-maintenance.' Sarah would say to you during Sunday brunch. She would tell you to avoid intelligent men, 'for they believe that they are better than you.'

Hmm. With those words infiltrating your thoughts, you decide that you would rather steer clear of intelligent men and choose differently. You go back to preferences.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Humorous" tags="cupid" position="507.5,1295.5" size="100,100">(text-colour:magenta)[//“Wow Aliyah! You have chosen to match with a humorous man. CUPID loves this choice. Funny men have a charm and energy about them that is extremely hard to deny. Marrying a man with a good sense of humour never gets boring. He is spontaneous and exciting because you have to be speedy to keep up with him. CUPID approves!”//]

You remember Anthony. The funny boy next door from your childhood. Dimpled Anthony. His English accent that sounded like a playful tune, as if he were the star of his own film. You would sit beside him all day, just to simply watch him smile.

You remember how he broke your heart. So broken, until you shed an ocean through your eyes. The years and years of pain that followed. Where your body trembled and shattered. 

Is he the reason you are here now? At 31, unmarried and on the brink of being exiled? Maybe funny guys are not the best after all.

You decide to go back and choose differently. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Sensitive" tags="cupid" position="657.5,1295.5" size="100,100">(text-colour:magenta)[//“You have chosen to match with a sensitive man. A man who is sensitive displays specific level of calmness that is admirable. He is confident in who he is, and has been taught to recognise and treasure his feelings as well as the feelings of others. A sensitive man projects a quiet self-assurance and could be the one for you to marry! CUPID adores this match.”
//]
In this moment, deep inside your fragmented mind, you get a glimpse of your father. 
“Aliyah, the sound of your feet running around the house, and your laughter ringing are the song lyrics in my dreams, my little one,” he would say to you when you were young. In your soul, the recollection awakens something deep within you that has been gone for a long time. 

You relive those perfect memories of your childhood. You can recall those adventures he would take you on through the city. You would soar in your skycar when everyone was asleep. Beyond the pink clouds, you could almost see the land of the exiled. Your father was a curious man, a rule breaker. But he was sensitive. You remember a conversation you heard him have with your mother 15 years ago. 

“There is no peace, love and happiness in exiling innocent people. President May is a tyrant. And everyone else is too afraid to retaliate. I don’t want our daughter to grow up in this so-called perfect nation, abiding by these ridiculous rules.” He had said. You instantly remember the confusion you had felt in that moment. How could he say such a thing about our president?

“Shh. Be quiet, Harun!” Your mother had snapped. “If anyone hears you speak this nonsense, you could get punished. I don’t want you to die, my love.”

He died 2 months after that conversation. 

He was taken in for treason and plotting against the government. With a group of ten others, he was publicly executed. 

You had decided that day, that you would always follow your heart like your father. But 15 years later, you are about to be exiled. Was your father in the wrong? Is being sensitive the same as being weak? 

You must make the right choice.

Should you choose a sensitive man like your father? A man who thinks of others before himself? 

You decide to go ahead and click [[yes]]

Wow. He was the kind of handsome that seeped straight into your bones. You could feel his aura through the screen of your computer. From the depth of his blue eyes to the soft expressions on his strong and structured featured. He was magnificent, and you could not believe that he was your match!

“I understand your feelings, Aliyah. But there comes a time when forcing one's ideas that could save our world becomes morally the right thing to do. We can’t live like this anymore. You said so yourself, this isn’t a fair system. I know for a fact that there is a society on the other side of the nation. Near the Australasia cities in the southern hemisphere. That is where the exiled people are sent to. My best friend illegally wrote to me from there when he was exiled last year. It’s a land of freedom. Please, I urge you to come with me. We can fix this world. We can do something about this with the help of like-minded individuals.”

“Jared… I need to think this through.”

Your mind keeps circling around this inevitable choice. 

It is then that you realise. You hate this country. 

Where the poor stay poor, the rich get richer, the media that jumps to serve its leader. A leader that rules with no mercy and claims that it is LOVE. She is lying, they are all lying. Your father was right. Love does not win in this nation, peace does not improve but is forced, and happiness is built on a lie.

You have made your decision.

“I am coming with you.”

“Thank god, Aliyah. This makes me so happy. I cannot assure you of this outcome, but the choice that we are making is a choice of hope. I am sure your father would have been proud. You and I will both decline this match. We will be exiled tomorrow once the results are taken to the president, along with everyone who has not found their match in time.

I will be wearing a blue hoodie. Find me.”
